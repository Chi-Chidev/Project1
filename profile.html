            <p class="about-me">My name is Esther Chinonye. I'm a product designer aspiring to become a full-stack
                developer.
                My journey into the tech world began in 2022,and let me tell you,
                it's been a rollercoaster ride, challenging yet totally awesome.
                There's much more to me than what you'll read here, so I encourage you to get to know me personally.
                Meanwhile, here's a sneak peek into my world.

            <h3 class="subtitle">My Fun Side</h3>
            <p class="about-me">Now, I guess this is the part where I get to talk about the fun stuff.
                Here are some things that makes me tick and brings a smile to my face.

            <p class="fun-things">I Love Games</p>
            <p>I absolutely love games, they bring out my energetic and
                playful side. When
                I say
                games, I mean interesting games, not <span id="special-text"><em>football</em></span>. I know, right?
                Shocking! Here are a few types of games that I can't get enough of:
            </p>
            <ul class="games">
                <li>Board games.</li>
                <li>Pad games.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="box2">
            <p class="fun-things">I Love A Good Read</p>
            <p>When it comes to books, I'm quite
                selective.
                I need something that will keep me engaged, not bored. Here are some of my top picks:
            </p>
            <ul class="books">
                <li>A broken people by Chimeka Garricks</li>
                <li>Sis don't settle by Faith Jenkins</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="subtitle">My Favorite Meals</h3>
        <p>Now, let me give you some insight into the kinds of foods I enjoy and crave daily. I might be a picky eater,
            but
            I certainly appreciate a good plate of food.
            Before I share my food menu, have you ever noticed that Nigerian cuisine, while delicious, doesn't offer a
            vast
            variety?
            If you disagree, try naming something beyond the usual suspects like swallow, rice, beans, yam, and potatoes
            (yes, I included potatoes to be generous).
            As someone who enjoys snacking more than full meals, I don't mind the limited options. So, if you're curious
            to
            see my favorite meals, just click on <a href="menu.html">My Favorite Menu List.</a>
